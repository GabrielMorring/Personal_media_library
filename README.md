# Cloud Database

I am using google firestore. It is a noSQL database.

Google firestore works by having collections that hold documents in the collections and each document is basically json data. 

# Development Environment

The tools I used for this project are

* Visual Studio Code
* Python
* Google firebase
* Git and Github

I used the firebase librarie with python to connect to the cloud database
