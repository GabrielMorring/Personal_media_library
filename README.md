# Overview

I made a program just to store information on what I (or anyone who uses it) like and don't like. It just stores the name of a thing a rating that you give it between one and ten, and a description of that thing.

I just made this program for fun and to learn a bit more about how to use a cloud database if I want to use one again.

# Cloud Database

I am using google firestore. It is a noSQL database.

Google firestore works by having collections that hold documents in the collections and each document is basically json data. 

# Development Environment

The tools I used for this project are

* Visual Studio Code
* Python
* Google firebase
* Git and Github

I used the firebase library with python to connect to the cloud database

# Useful Websites

# Future Work

* fix bugs
* make user errors not doable
